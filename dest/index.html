    <h2>How to use this tool</h2>

      "Show Differences" button to see the differences between the two blocks of

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
      This is a simple text comparison tool. It will compare two blocks of text
      and highlight the differences between them. It is useful for comparing
      different versions of text, or for comparing two different pieces of text
      to see what the differences are.

    <h2>Why was it made?</h2>
    <p>
      It is a useful feature for quick comparisons and I wanted to help others
      in this area. As an additional goal, getting a little income from it would
      be nice. Despite wanting a little income, I'm not going to spam you with a
      bunch of ads all over the page.
